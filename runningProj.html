    <p>Running has been a part of human life since the beginning of time. It is a
        way to escape, connect with nature, and push one&#39;s limits. Distance
        running, in particular, has been my passion for many years. What started
        as just the races I was begrudgingly assigned when I ran track in middle
        school, has now become an integral part of my life.

    <p>I was introduced to running in my elementary days, where I was trained on
        various breathing techniques and the benefits running offers. Over time, I
        witnessed the way it helped me stay focused, determined, and disciplined.
        Witnessing these benefits firsthand, I became passionate about it.</p>

    <p>The inspiration to continue this passion came from some of the most
        famous long-distance runners such as Emil Zatopek, Paula Radcliffe, and
        Eliud Kipchoge. Their accomplishments in the sport, like Kipchoge running
        a sub 2 hour marathon, continue to motivate me to push harder and strive
        to hit new fitness goals. I also find inspiration in everyday runners, who I
        run into on my runs, who go out there every day and run, regardless of
        their fitness levels or running goals.</p>
